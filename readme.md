## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/getblackboard/starter_theme
```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```
cd projectname
npm install
bower install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run Gulp. Your finished site will be created in a folder called `dist`, viewable at this URL:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

To create compressed, production-ready assets, run `npm run build`.
